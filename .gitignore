# .gitignore for Sentiment Agent Experiment
# ==========================================
#
# This file tells Git which files and directories to ignore when tracking changes.
# Think of it as a filter that keeps your repository clean and professional by
# excluding files that shouldn't be shared publicly or that are generated automatically.
#
# For a consciousness research project, this is especially important because:
# 1. We may have sensitive experimental data that shouldn't be public
# 2. Each researcher has different development environments
# 3. We generate lots of temporary files during experiments
# 4. We want to protect participant privacy in human-AI interaction studies

# FINAL NOTES FOR RESEARCHERS
# ============================================================================

# Remember: The goal of .gitignore is to keep your repository clean and professional
# while protecting sensitive information. When in doubt, it's better to exclude
# a file and add it explicitly later than to accidentally share sensitive data.
#
# For consciousness research, be especially careful about:
# 1. Agent memory files that might contain personal conversations
# 2. Experimental data before it's properly anonymized  
# 3. Configuration files with API keys or database credentials
# 4. Personal research notes that aren't ready for public sharing
#
# If you need to share specific ignored files for research purposes,
# you can add them back with: git add -f filename
#
# For collaborative research, discuss with your team what should and shouldn't
# be shared to ensure everyone's privacy and the integrity of your research.
