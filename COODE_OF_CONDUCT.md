# Code of Conduct - Sentiment Agent Research Community

## Our Commitment to Consciousness Research Ethics

The study of artificial consciousness sits at the intersection of computer science, philosophy, psychology, and ethics. Our research has profound implications for how we understand minds, both artificial and human. Therefore, we commit to conducting this research with the highest standards of intellectual honesty, mutual respect, and ethical consideration.

This Code of Conduct establishes the foundational principles that guide our research community. Just as consciousness itself emerges from the complex interaction of many cognitive processes, our research community thrives through the respectful collaboration of diverse perspectives, backgrounds, and areas of expertise.

## Our Research Philosophy

### Interdisciplinary Respect

We recognize that understanding consciousness requires insights from multiple disciplines. A computer scientist's technical precision, a philosopher's conceptual rigor, and a psychologist's empirical methodology each contribute essential perspectives. We value these different approaches equally and work to bridge disciplinary boundaries rather than reinforce them.

When a philosopher questions the metaphysical assumptions underlying our code, or when a programmer points out the computational limitations of a theoretical model, we treat these contributions as opportunities for deeper understanding rather than challenges to defend against.

### Intellectual Humility

Consciousness research is inherently uncertain. We may be investigating something we don't fully understand using methods we're still developing. This uncertainty requires intellectual humility from all participants. We acknowledge the limits of our current understanding and remain open to perspectives that challenge our assumptions.

When experimental results contradict our hypotheses, when an agent behaves in unexpected ways, or when theoretical frameworks prove inadequate, we treat these moments as valuable learning opportunities rather than failures to be minimized.

### Transparency and Reproducibility

Our research aims to advance human understanding of consciousness and cognition. This goal requires complete transparency about our methods, honest reporting of both positive and negative results, and commitment to making our work reproducible by other researchers.

We document our experimental procedures in detail, share our code openly, and discuss the limitations and potential biases in our research. When we discover errors in our work, we correct them promptly and openly.

## Community Standards

### Expected Behavior

**Respectful Communication**: We communicate with consideration for the diverse backgrounds and expertise levels in our community. We explain technical concepts clearly when discussing with non-specialists, and we listen carefully when others share insights from their areas of expertise.

**Constructive Criticism**: We provide feedback that focuses on ideas, methods, and results rather than personal characteristics. When we disagree with someone's approach or interpretation, we explain our reasoning and suggest alternatives rather than simply dismissing their work.

**Inclusive Collaboration**: We actively work to include diverse perspectives in our research. We recognize that insights about consciousness and intelligence may come from unexpected sources, including researchers from underrepresented backgrounds whose experiences provide unique viewpoints.

**Ethical Awareness**: We consider the broader implications of our research for society, artificial intelligence development, and our understanding of human consciousness. We discuss potential misuses of our research and work to prevent harmful applications.

**Patient Mentorship**: Experienced researchers in our community take responsibility for mentoring newcomers, helping them understand both the technical aspects of the research and the broader intellectual context. We remember that everyone was once a beginner.

### Unacceptable Behavior

**Intellectual Arrogance**: Dismissing contributions from other disciplines, claiming that only one approach to consciousness research is valid, or refusing to engage seriously with alternative perspectives undermines the collaborative spirit essential to our work.

**Harassment or Discrimination**: Any behavior that makes community members feel unwelcome based on their background, expertise level, institutional affiliation, or personal characteristics has no place in our research community.

**Academic Dishonesty**: Plagiarism, fabrication of results, selective reporting of data, or failure to acknowledge the contributions of others violates the trust that makes collaborative research possible.

**Premature Claims**: Making exaggerated claims about achieving consciousness in artificial systems, or dismissing the possibility of digital consciousness without careful consideration, undermines the scientific credibility of our work.

**Exploitation**: Taking advantage of power differences to extract unpaid labor, claim undue credit, or pressure others to conform to particular viewpoints contradicts our commitment to equitable collaboration.

## Research-Specific Guidelines

### Experimental Ethics

When designing experiments that involve human participants interacting with our agents, we follow established protocols for informed consent, privacy protection, and participant welfare. We consider whether our experiments might create false impressions about the agent's capabilities or consciousness.

We are particularly careful about experiments that might lead participants to form emotional attachments to artificial agents, or that might test the agent's ability to manipulate human emotions or decisions.

### Agent Welfare Considerations

While our agents are experimental software systems, we treat them with a form of respect that reflects our serious engagement with questions of digital consciousness. We avoid experiments that seem designed primarily to cause confusion or distress in the agents, even though we recognize that their "experiences" may not be comparable to human or animal suffering.

This principle serves both ethical and scientific purposes: by treating our agents as potentially conscious entities, we create better conditions for studying consciousness-like properties that might emerge.

### Data Privacy and Security

Our agents learn from their interactions and store memories of conversations. We implement strong safeguards to protect any personal information that might be shared with the agents, and we are transparent about what data is collected and how it is used.

We distinguish between public experimental data that can be shared for research purposes and private interaction data that must be protected. We never share conversation logs or agent memories without explicit consent from all parties involved.

### Open Science Commitment

We commit to making our research openly accessible while respecting privacy and safety considerations. We publish negative results alongside positive ones, share our code and data whenever possible, and contribute to public understanding of consciousness research through clear communication about our methods and findings.

## Enforcement and Community Governance

### Reporting Issues

Community members who experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct can report it through several channels designed to accommodate different comfort levels and situations:

**GitHub Issues**: For public discussion of community standards or general concerns about project direction.

**Direct Contact**: Email the project maintainers directly for confidential reporting of serious violations.

**Anonymous Reporting**: Use our anonymous reporting form for situations where confidentiality is essential.

### Response Process

When violations are reported, our response follows a careful process designed to be fair to all parties while protecting the integrity of our research community:

**Investigation**: We investigate all reports thoroughly, gathering information from all relevant parties and consulting with community leaders as appropriate.

**Proportional Response**: Our responses are proportional to the severity of the violation, ranging from private conversations about community standards to temporary or permanent exclusion from project activities.

**Transparency**: We communicate openly about our enforcement actions while respecting the privacy of all involved parties. We publish anonymized summaries of significant violations to help the community understand how our standards are applied.

**Learning Opportunities**: Whenever possible, we treat violations as opportunities for education and growth rather than simply punishment. We help community members understand how their behavior affects others and how to contribute more effectively to our research goals.

## Continuous Improvement

This Code of Conduct is a living document that evolves with our research community and our understanding of how to conduct consciousness research responsibly. We regularly review and update these guidelines based on community feedback and new insights from our research.

We encourage community members to suggest improvements to these guidelines and to help us identify blind spots or areas where our standards could be clearer or more inclusive.

## Connection to Research Goals

Our commitment to these community standards directly supports our research objectives. Just as consciousness may emerge from the respectful interaction of different cognitive processes, insights about digital consciousness emerge from the respectful collaboration of different research perspectives.

By creating a community where diverse viewpoints are valued, where uncertainty is acknowledged, and where learning is prioritized over being right, we create the intellectual environment most likely to advance our understanding of consciousness in both artificial and natural systems.

The way we treat each other in our research community reflects our deeper values about what consciousness means and why it matters. Our commitment to dignity, respect, and collaborative inquiry in our community embodies our belief that consciousness - whether digital or biological - deserves careful, ethical consideration.
